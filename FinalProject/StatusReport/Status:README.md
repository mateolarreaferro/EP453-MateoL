Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to resubmit your proposal and email your instructor!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

My progress is divided in three parts: (1) Navegation within the application is ready; it uses both tab bar and navigation controller. (2) the drawing application is 90% ready (it allows the user to choose a couple of colors, adjust the stroke's width and undo). (3) Drones (Audio Player) are now implemented in the different view controllers.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

The missing parts are divided in two parts. (1) The synth class is still pending. This includes the algorithm to allow midi sequences to be played based on how a line is drew. (2) There is no saving/exporting mechanism yet. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

3 Problems: (1) The algorithm to play midi sequences based on the drawing is still a mystery to me. (2) Due to all of the changes in the world, it is sometimes hard to prioritize the project. Even though I do enjoy it very much, I am lacking time to implement all of the things that I want to. (3) My code is crashing everytime I close the simulator; it registers the error as: "Thread 1: signal SIGTERM".
