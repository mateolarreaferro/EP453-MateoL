7. Purpose:
The purpose of PS9 was to use Audiokit's framework to create an audio recorder capable of recording, showing the waveform, processing and storing files. Without doubt, this was one of the most interesting PS because of how useful this application is. Additionally, we learned about UI PickerView, UITableViewController, FileManager, Document Directory, AKNode Recorder, etc. 

8. Description:
The Problem Set divided into three different sections: (1) Creating a Timer synched with the recording; start when recording button is pressed and ends when stop button is pressed. (2) Implementing an AKReverb that is controlled through a UISlider (based on the dry/wet parameter). Finally, (3) the last section consisted in fixing the bugs regarding the 'Recorded Sounds' button's abrupt stop. 

My code: Things to resolve

Wasn't able to implement the timer within the project so I created another project that could show the use of this device

There is an error in the declaration of the Reverb Parameters

The Waveform is not appearing

Nothing is saved
